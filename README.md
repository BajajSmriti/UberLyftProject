# UberLyftProject
In this project, we conducted an analysis of the Boston, MA dataset to gain insights into the factors affecting ride pricing models. We took several preprocessing steps, including removing outliers, missing and duplicate values, and selecting features based on heatmaps and statistical analysis. This analysis helped us to identify patterns in ride demand and pricing, which can be used to optimize ride-hailing services, enhance the customer experience, and improve the ride-sharing industry. We also worked on visualizing the average number of rides per hour, this information could be useful for organizations to optimize their marketing strategies in specific neighborhoods during specific hours. In addition to this, we developed predictive models to estimate future ride prices and created an RShiny web application to explore these statistics and predictive modeling results. We compared the pricing strategies of Uber and Lyft services and discovered that Lyft offered more affordable pricing compared to Uber. However, we believe that there is more room for improvement in the overall ride-sharing experience by considering additional factors, such as user reviews and ratings. By examining these aspects, ride-sharing companies can enhance the customer experience, leading to increased customer loyalty and retention.
